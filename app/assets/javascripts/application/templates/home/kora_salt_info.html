        to issue Tokens in the future for tax purposes, and shall not take any position on any tax return, report,
        statement or other tax document that is inconsistent with such treatment unless required by applicable Law, a
        closing agreement with an applicable tax authority or a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
        jurisdiction. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that significant aspects of the tax treatment of the matters
        and transactions pursuant to this SAFT are uncertain and the applicable tax authorities could assert a different
        tax treatment than described above. The Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Company has not sought a
        ruling from any tax authority, nor has the Company obtained an opinion of counsel, with respect to any tax
        issues relating to the matters and transactions under this SAFT. Because of this uncertainty, the Purchaser
        represents that it has consulted with its own tax advisor about its own tax situation. The Purchaser understands
        that the Purchaser bears sole responsibility for any taxes as a result of the matters and transactions that are
        the subject of this SAFT, and any future acquisition, ownership, use, sale or other disposition of Tokens held
        by the Purchaser. To the extent permitted by Law, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Company
        or any of its Representatives, developers, auditors and contractors harmless against any claim, liability,
        assessment or penalty with respect to any taxes (other than any net income taxes of the Company that result from
        the issuance of Tokens to the Purchaser pursuant to <a style="border-bottom: 0.5px solid;" ng-click="scrollTo('section2')">Section 2(b)</a>) associated with
        or arising from the Purchaser’s acceptance of the Tokens, or the use or ownership of Tokens.</p></span>
    <span id="section65"><p><b style="padding-left: 5em">Section 65.</b> Confidentiality</span>. Except as required by Law, the Purchaser shall not, and shall
        cause its Representatives and affiliates not to, discuss the terms of this SAFT or the Tokens with any third
        party other than the Purchaser’s accountants, tax advisors or attorneys who are subject to confidentiality
        obligations no less restrictive than those included in this SAFT. In addition, the Purchaser shall not use the
        name or marks of the Company or any of its affiliates in any manner, context or format (including reference on
        or links to the websites, press releases, etc.) without the prior written approval of the Company.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose to any and all Persons the tax treatment and tax
        structure of the matters and transactions under this SAFT and all materials of any kind (including opinions or
        other tax analyses, if any) that are provided to the other Party relating to such tax treatment and tax
        structure. For this purpose, “tax structure” means any facts relevant to the U.S. federal income tax treatment
        of any transaction under this SAFT.</p></span>
    <span id="section66"><p><b style="padding-left: 5em">Section 66.</b> Further Assurances</span>. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to,
        execute and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such further
        actions as may be reasonably requested by Company to carry out the provisions of this SAFT and give effect to
        the Transaction, including to enable the Company to comply with applicable Laws.</p></span>

        conditions of this SAFT will inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the respective successors and assigns
        of the Parties; <em>provided</em>, <em>however</em>, that the Purchaser may not assign its obligations under
        this SAFT without the written consent of the Company. This SAFT is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their
        respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or will
        confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or

        be delivered via electronic mail (including PDF or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal

        Party hereto shall raise the use of e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” or similar format data file to deliver a

        through the use of e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” or similar format data file as a defense to the formation or
        enforceability of a contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.</p></span>

<p><strong><span id="scheduleD" style="border-bottom: 0.5px solid;">Schedule D – Risk Factors</span></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Please read these risk factors carefully. The impact of any of the risks outlined below could be highly
    material and could result in the SAFT and the Tokens having little or no value whatsoever. Capitalized terms used
    and not defined in this</strong></em> <em><strong>Schedule D have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in
    the SAFT to which this</strong></em> <em><strong>Schedule D is attached.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Risks Related to our Business</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We have no operational history and have no basis to evaluate our potential for future
    success.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Company was formed in December 2017. We have, since then, been creating our technology through research and
    development. However, we have no operational history and cannot fully evaluate our business and prospects. Investors
    in the SAFT must consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies like ours. If
    we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties, the business may be seriously harmed or may
    fail.</p>
<p><em><strong>We may not be able to successfully implement our business model.</strong></em></p>
<p>We are in the process of implementing our business model. We are still in the early stages of developing our business
    strategy and technological capabilities. We face a number of challenges, including a lack of meaningful historical
    financial data upon which to plan future budgets and competition from a wide range of sources. As a result, we may
    not be able to successfully implement our business model.</p>
<p><em><strong>We have generated no revenues, have incurred only losses and may not become profitable in the
    future.</strong></em></p>
<p>Since incorporation, we have not generated any operational revenues and we have incurred only losses, principally
    from costs relating to research and development, legal expenses, salaries and consulting fees. We expect to continue
    to incur net operating losses through at least 2019 and possibly beyond. Our business model and strategies may not
    be successful and there is no assurance that we will ever become profitable in any future period.</p>
<p><em><strong>We may require additional funding, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at
    all.</strong></em></p>
<p>We plan to continue to expend substantial capital in connection with the development of the Kora Network. If we fail
    to obtain the funding necessary to fund such research and development and to satisfy our working capital needs, we
    may have to delay our plans in connection with the Kora Network Launch. To the extent available capital resources
    are insufficient to meet future capital requirements, we will have to seek additional funds to continue with our
    expansion plan. There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. If
    adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or even altogether. Our
    inability to raise capital on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.</p>
<p><strong>We are highly dependent on management and other key employees.</strong></p>
<p>We are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of our Chief Executive Officer, Dickson Nsofor, and our Chief
    Operating Officer, Daniel Hu. The loss of Dickson Nsofor or Daniel Hu, or any of our other officers or key employees
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, existing business or anticipated growth.</p>
<p><em><strong>Risks Associated with the Kora Network Launch</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>If the Kora Network does not launch, you will not receive the Tokens and you will not be refunded the entire
    amount of your Purchase Price.</strong></p>
<p>The Kora Network has yet to launch and is currently under development. Although the Company intends to use the
    proceeds from the Transaction (i) to develop and complete the Kora Network, (ii) to conduct the Kora Network Launch,
    and (iii) for general corporate and working capital purposes (in each case, in the Company’s sole discretion), the
    Company can provide no assurances that the Kora Network will launch. If the Kora Network does not launch, your
    rights and remedies are limited to those under the SAFT and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.
    In particular, twenty percent (20%) of your Purchase Price constitutes the nonrefundable portion of your Purchase
    Price and will not be refunded to you in any event, including if the Kora Network does not launch. Accordingly, if
    the Kora Network does not launch, you will only be entitled to the Returned Investment Amount, subject to the
    availability of funds.</p>
<p><strong>If the Kora Network does launch but its functionality does not meet users’ expectations, the value of the
    Tokens, if any, may be materially and adversely affected.</strong></p>
<p>The Kora Network has yet to launch and is currently under development. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the
    form and functionality of the Kora Network or the Tokens, including user behavior, and any or all expectations or
    assumptions that you may have, may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons, including mistaken
    assumptions or analyses, a change in the design and implementation plans, and execution of the Kora Network or
    client applications. If the Kora Network launches, but the functionality and usefulness of the Kora Network does not
    meet users’ expectations, the value of the Tokens may be materially and adversely affected.</p>
<p><strong>The Company may dissolve, which could prevent or impede the Kora Network Launch or negatively affect the
    operation of the Kora Network, and you may lose all or substantially all of your entire Purchase Price.</strong></p>
<p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons (many of which are out of our control), including an unfavorable
    fluctuation in the value of cryptocurrencies, development issues with the Kora Network, the failure of business
    relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the Kora Network project may no longer be viable as a
    business or otherwise and the project or the Company may dissolve or fail to launch. In such event, you may lose
    your entire Purchase Price, or the amount repaid to you as the Returned Investment Amount pursuant to this SAFT may
    be substantially less than the Purchase Price you paid.</p>
<p><strong>Reliance on Third-Parties.</strong></p>
<p>The Kora Network will rely, in whole or partly, on third-party service providers. There is no assurance or guarantee
    that those third-party service providers will complete their work or properly carry out their obligations, all of
    which might have a material adverse effect on the Kora Network.</p>
<p><em><strong>Risks Associated with the SAFT and the Tokens</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The SAFT cannot be transferred.</strong></p>
<p>The terms of the SAFT prohibit transfer of the SAFT. As a result, purchasers will be required to hold their SAFT
    until the earlier of the Kora Network Launch and the delivery of all of the Tokens, or the termination of the SAFT
    pursuant to the provisions set forth therein. Consequently, purchasers must be prepared to bear the risk of an
    investment in the SAFT until the termination of the SAFT pursuant to the terms set forth therein.</p>
<p><strong>Your ability to transfer the Tokens may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is
    no assurance that any active trading market shall develop for the Tokens.</strong></p>
<p>The Tokens issuable under this SAFT have not been created and will only be created at a future date in furtherance of
    the completion, establishment and operation of the Kora Network. Accordingly, there is currently no established
    trading market for the Tokens and an active market for the Tokens may not develop or, if developed, it may not be
    maintained. The liquidity of any market for the Tokens will depend on a variety of factors, including the number of
    holders of the Tokens, the performance of the Kora Network, the market for similar tokens, and the interest of
    market participants in making a market in the Tokens and other factors. If a market develops, the Tokens could trade
    at prices that may be lower than your Purchase Price. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the
    price and liquidity of the Tokens may be materially and adversely affected.</p>
<p><strong>The transfer of the Tokens is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which
    they may be sold.</strong></p>
<p>The Tokens have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities Laws of any other
    jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a
    transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable Laws. These
    restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Tokens. For example, Rule 144, the primary exemption
    for resales of restricted securities imposes a one-year holding period for restricted securities of companies, such
    as the Company, that do not provide current information to the public. It is your responsibility to ensure that all
    offers and sales of the Tokens within the United States and other jurisdictions comply with applicable securities
    and other Laws. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Tokens, and do not have any intention
    to do so in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Holders of Tokens may lose access to those Tokens if they can no longer access their token wallets.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Tokens, when generated and delivered, shall be controllable only by the possessor of unique private keys relating
    to the addresses in which the Tokens are held. The theft, loss or destructions of a private key required to access
    Tokens is irreversible, and because the Company does not have access to those private keys, such private keys could
    not be restored by the Company, and the Company shall not be responsible for the theft, loss or destruction of any
    private key or a Purchaser’s loss of access to its digital wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Your Tokens may be stolen, transferred, or used by others if your credentials are compromised.</strong></p>
<p>Any Person that gains access to or learns of your credentials or private keys may be able to use or dispose of your
    Tokens. The Company will not have the ability or responsibility to restore Tokens that have been transferred or
    stolen. Unlike bank accounts or accounts at financial institutions, the Tokens shall be uninsured and, in the event
    of any loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC or SIPC in the United States, or private insurer, to offer
    recourse to you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Risks Associated with the Kora Network</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The Kora Network may malfunction due to problems with its blockchain infrastructure or any other blockchain
    on which the Kora Network is built.</strong></p>
<p>The Kora Network is a platform intended to be based on its own proprietary blockchain. As such, any malfunction,
    unintended function, unexpected functioning of, or attack on, its blockchain infrastructure may cause the Kora
    Network to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner.</p>
<p><strong>If there is insufficient interest in the Kora Network or blockchain technologies, the Tokens may have limited
    or no utility or value.</strong></p>
<p>It is possible that the Kora Network application shall not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and
    other organizations and that there shall be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed
    applications. Such a lack of interest could negatively impact the utility of the Tokens.</p>
<p>While the Tokens should not be viewed as an investment, they may have value over time. That value may be limited and
    may be zero if the Kora Network lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the case, there may be few or no markets
    following the launch of the application, potentially having an adverse impact on the value of the Tokens.</p>
<p><strong>If the Company fails to continuously adapt its business model to meet the market needs, it may have negative
    consequence on its operations and revenue stream, which in turn could negatively impact the operation of the Kora
    Network as well as the value of the Tokens.</strong></p>
<p>The Company’s market is increasingly attracting new players from across the world. Recognizing such popularity, many
    governments are paying attention, drafting new Laws to regulate such market. The Company plans to adapt its business
    model against competitions and to the changing regulatory landscape. However, there is no guarantee that such
    efforts shall necessarily lead to successful adaption to the market and the continued success of the Kora
    Network.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive technologies could negatively impact the value of the Tokens.</strong></p>
<p>If a competitive technology is launched before or after the Kora Network Launch, users interested in a platform like
    the Kora Network may use that technology in lieu of the Kora Network. In that case, the lack of use could limit the
    utility and value of the Tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Security weaknesses could negatively impact the operation of the Kora Network.</strong></p>
<p>Developers involved in the creation and operation of the Kora Network software may unintentionally introduce
    weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Kora Network that could interfere with the
    operation of the Kora Network or result in the loss of Tokens. Further, there can be no assurance that developers or
    other third parties do not introduce such weaknesses or bugs intentionally.</p>
<p><em><strong>Risks Associated with the Underlying Blockchain Technology</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The technology underlying the Kora Network is new and may be subject to additional risks.</strong></p>
<p>Cryptographic tokens are a fairly novel and relatively untested technology. In addition to the risks discussed
    herein, there are risks that the Company and the developers of the Kora Network cannot anticipate. Further risks may
    materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.</p>
<p>In addition, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could
    present risks to cryptographic tokens (including the Tokens) and the Kora Network, which could result in the theft
    or loss of Tokens.</p>
<p>The blockchain that the Kora Network may be built on has inherent risks and is susceptible to mining attacks,
    including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks.
    Any successful attacks on the blockchain network that the Kora Network is built on present a risk to the Kora
    Network, the Tokens, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations, and the Company shall
    have no ability to mitigate any such attacks happening on the blockchain network.</p>
<p>Additionally, centralized access portals on internet servers are subject to similar attacks such as denial-of-service
    (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, which can also present issues of security to the network.</p>
<p><strong>Stress on the blockchain on which the Kora Network is built can slow down transactions and/or increase costs
    associated with the transactions on the network which may negatively impact Kora Network’s operations.</strong></p>
<p>As with any blockchain networks, a large transaction volume can put a strain on the network, slowing down the
    transaction time and/or increasing costs for the transactions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Legal and Regulatory Risks</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Intellectual property claims may adversely affect the operation of the Kora Network.</strong></p>
<p>Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the operation of the Kora Network or the holding or
    transfer of the Tokens. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened
    action that reduces confidence in Kora Network’s long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and
    transfer Tokens may adversely affect the usefulness and value of the Tokens. Additionally, a meritorious
    intellectual property claim could prevent the Company from improving, or end users from accessing, the Kora Network
    or holding or transferring their Tokens, which could adversely impact the utility of the Kora Network or the value
    of the Tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory requirements imposed on remittance lending and related activities may negatively affect the
    operation of the Kora Network.</strong></p>
<p>Remittance, lending and related activities are heavily regulated in all the countries that the Kora Network intends
    to operate and may subject the Kora Network or the Kora Network participants to licensing obligations, compliance
    obligations, supervision, examination and/or litigation. This would extend to all aspects of the Kora Network
    transaction lifecycle, including advertisements and solicitations, digital wallets, money transmission, the
    preparation and use of credit scores, underwriting, agreements and disclosures, payment terms, and debt collection
    practices. The functioning of the Kora Network could be impacted by these regulatory and compliance obligations, by
    the supervision and examination of platform activities, or by one or more regulatory inquiries, actions or civil
    litigation. Any such impact could be negative and material and could result in the Token having little or no value
    whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory requirements imposed on token exchange activities may negatively affect the operation of the Kora
    Network.</strong></p>
<p>Money transmission and token exchange services are heavily regulated, and providing such services on the Kora Network
    may subject the platform to licensing obligations, compliance obligations, and/or regulatory supervision and
    examination. Such compliance obligations may include implementing a comprehensive Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money
    laundering compliance program, including know your customer and customer identification program procedures,
    automated transaction monitoring, compliance with capital control laws, Laws applicable to payment systems operators
    in the countries in which the Kora Network intends to operate and require reporting and recordkeeping. In addition,
    the Kora Network may be expected to have a comprehensive sanctions screening program and its operation in certain
    jurisdictions may be subject to it receiving the relevant regulatory authorization. The functioning of the Kora
    Network could be impacted by these regulatory and compliance obligations, the supervision and examination of
    platform activities, or one or more regulatory inquiries or actions.</p>
<p><strong>Unfavorable legal or regulatory action could impact the utility of the Kora Network and Tokens, as well as
    the value of Tokens.</strong></p>
<p>Blockchain technologies and peer-to-peer remittance and lending have been the subject of scrutiny by various
    regulatory bodies in United States and around the world. For example, jurisdictions such as the People’s Republic of
    China and South Korea have prohibited or significantly limited the ability to sell and use blockchain tokens, and
    regulators of other jurisdictions, such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, have confirmed that
    blockchain tokens may be securities and subject to sale and resale restrictions. In Hong Kong, the SFO has stated
    that digital tokens may fall within the definition of securities under Hong Kong’s securities laws depending on the
    digital tokens’ features. The functioning of the Kora Network, and the terms or use of the Tokens, could be impacted
    by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including the licensing of or restrictions on the use, sale, or
    possession of digital tokens like the Tokens, which could impede, limit or end the development of the Kora Network
    or use or value of the Tokens.</p>
<p><strong>The Tokens shall not be, and should not be viewed as, legal tender of any jurisdiction, and may not have any
    intrinsic value.</strong></p>
<p>When generated and delivered, the Tokens shall not be the generally accepted measure of value/medium of exchange
    within any country and its framework is not defined by the Laws of any country. There are not now, and shall not be
    at the time of delivery, any central banks or monetary authorities responsible for the Tokens’ value. The Token does
    not have any tangible or physical manifestation and may not have any intrinsic value (nor shall the Company nor any
    other Person give any commitment to its value).</p>
<p><strong>The tax treatment of the SAFT and the Token is uncertain and there may be adverse tax consequences for
    Purchasers upon certain future events.</strong></p>
<p>The tax characterization of the SAFT and the Tokens is uncertain, and each Purchaser must seek its own tax advice in
    connection with the SAFT and the Tokens. The purchase of the SAFT and the acceptance of the Tokens may result in
    adverse tax consequences to purchasers, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
    Each purchaser should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional tax advisors with respect
    to the U.S. and non-U.S. tax treatment of the SAFT and the Tokens.</p>
